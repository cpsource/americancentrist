        <p class="lead">The state of Tennessee has experienced significant economic impacts due to recent policies and actions associated with former President Donald Trump. These impacts span various sectors, including whiskey exports, the automotive industry, federal employment, and tourism.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Key Impacts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whiskey Exports:</strong> Potential losses of approximately <strong>$4 million annually</strong> due to tariffs on exports to Canada. These losses could grow if consumer boycotts accompany the tariffs.</li>
            <li><strong>Automotive Industry:</strong> The sector could incur losses up to <strong>$2.85 billion</strong> if 25% tariffs are applied to trade with Mexico and Canada, threatening jobs and financial stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Federal Employment:</strong> Job cuts in Middle Tennessee as part of efforts to reduce the federal workforce, introducing uncertainty and financial strain to families.</li>
            <li><strong>Tourism:</strong> Decline in Canadian tourists visiting Tennessee, negatively affecting local businesses in the hospitality and service industries.</li>
        </ul>
