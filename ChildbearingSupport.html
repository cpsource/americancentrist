        <h2>Incentivizing Parenthood</h2>
        <p>To encourage and support families, we pledge to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide new parents the opportunity to attend a seminar on this plan.</li>
            <li>Pay the family unit <strong>$50,000 tax-free</strong> for every child born, with an additional <strong>$25,000 tax-free</strong> if the parental male is married and cohabitating.</li>
            <li>Offer <strong>13 weeks of paid parental leave</strong> for both parents.</li>
            <li>Ensure <strong>free healthcare</strong> from conception through the child’s first two years.</li>
            <li>Provide a comprehensive <strong>birthing class</strong> during pregnancy for both parents.</li>
            <li>If the child is placed for adoption, the birth mother receives <strong>$25,000 tax-free</strong>.</li>
            <li>Distribute a <strong>neonatal care kit</strong> to the mother at birth.</li>
            <li>Offer <strong>free nursing visits</strong> up to the child's second year.</li>
            <li>Provide <strong>free infant childcare</strong> for the first two years.</li>
            <li>Ensure access to <strong>breastfeeding support</strong> if needed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Parental Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>In return, parents must meet the following responsibilities:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the child receives <strong>all recommended vaccinations</strong>.</li>
            <li>Store any firearms in the home <strong>locked, unloaded, and secured</strong> with an approved device, out of reach of children.</li>
            <li>Provide a <strong>safe and loving home</strong> environment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Failure to meet these responsibilities terminates eligibility for this program.</strong></p>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>Our goals with this initiative are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To <strong>reduce the number of abortions</strong> to near zero in practice.</li>
            <li>To <strong>promote a stable family structure</strong> for children.</li>
            <li>To <strong>reverse the national population decline</strong> and secure America’s future.</li>
        </ul>
