      <h2>What is YourVote?</h2>
      <p>
        YourVote is a new initiative proposed by the American Centrist movement to give everyday citizens a stronger voice in governance. Instead of only voting every two or four years for candidates, YourVote allows citizens to vote on individual issues throughout the year. It is envisioned as a government-run platform—secure, transparent, and accessible to all eligible voters.

      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <li class="list-group-item">Each major issue is presented on the platform with clear <strong>pro</strong> and <strong>con</strong> arguments.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Before voting, users take a brief quiz to confirm a basic understanding of the issue.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Each citizen may cast <strong>one vote per issue</strong>.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Results are visible to all and are sent directly to lawmakers, making the public’s stance unmistakable.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Washington, D.C., has become an echo chamber where lobbyists speak louder than voters. YourVote is a digital megaphone for the American people. It peels away the influence bubble and brings grassroots opinion to the forefront—issue by issue. By bridging this gap, YourVote ensures that elected officials hear not just lobbyists, but <strong>you</strong>.
