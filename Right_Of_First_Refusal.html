        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Right of First Refusal for Employees When a Company is Sold</h1>
        <p class="lead">This policy would require that when a business owner decides to sell their company, they must first offer the employees a chance to buy the business. This "right of first refusal" ensures that before selling to outside buyers, the company's workers get the opportunity to match the offer and take ownership of the business themselves.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why Is This Important?</h3>
        <p>When a company is sold, it often creates uncertainty for employees. New owners might:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cut jobs to reduce costs.</li>
            <li>Slash benefits or change working conditions.</li>
            <li>Restructure the company, leading to layoffs or relocation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By giving employees the first chance to buy the company, this policy aims to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Protect jobs and employee benefits.</li>
            <li>Maintain company culture and stability.</li>
            <li>Empower workers to take control of their workplace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How Does This Combat "Vulture Capitalism"?</h3>
        <h4>What Is Vulture Capitalism?</h4>
        <p>Vulture capitalism refers to the business practice where investment firms or wealthy buyers purchase struggling companies at low prices. Their goal is often to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sell off assets for quick profits.</li>
            <li>Lay off employees and cut costs drastically.</li>
            <li>Resell the business in pieces, often leaving the community and workers worse off.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How Would This Policy Help?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reduces the appeal for vulture capitalists who look to profit by dismantling companies.</li>
            <li>Employee-owned companies are more likely to prioritize job preservation and long-term stability over quick financial gains.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h3>Advantages of Employee-Owned Companies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Job Security:</strong> Employees who own their company are less likely to lay themselves off, increasing stability.</li>
            <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Ownership gives employees a direct stake in the success of the company, leading to higher motivation and performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Economic Fairness:</strong> Profits are shared among all employees, reducing income inequality and building wealth among working-class families.</li>
            <li><strong>Stronger Communities:</strong> Employee-owned companies are less likely to relocate overseas, maintaining local jobs and contributing to the local economy.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>
        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>By empowering workers with a "right of first refusal," this policy promotes a fairer economy. It encourages stable employment, protects communities, and discourages predatory business practices. The American Centrist Party supports worker ownership models as a practical step toward economic justice and long-term prosperity for all Americans.</p>
