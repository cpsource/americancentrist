        <h1 class="mb-4">Social Security Wage Base</h1>
        <p>The <strong>income cap</strong> for <strong>Social Security taxes</strong> is called the <strong>"Social Security Wage Base"</strong>, also known as the <strong>"Contribution and Benefit Base."</strong></p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-4">What Does It Mean?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Social Security Wage Base</strong> is the <strong>maximum income</strong> subject to <strong>Social Security payroll taxes</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Wages</strong> and <strong>self-employment income</strong> earned <strong>above this cap</strong> are <strong>not subject</strong> to the <strong>6.2% Social Security tax</strong> (<strong>12.4%</strong> for <strong>self-employed</strong>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">2024 Example:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>Social Security Wage Base</strong> for <strong>2024</strong> is <strong>$168,600</strong>.</li>
            <li>If you earn <strong>$200,000</strong>, you only pay <strong>Social Security taxes</strong> on the <strong>first $168,600</strong>.</li>
            <li>The <strong>6.2% tax</strong> on <strong>$168,600</strong> results in a <strong>maximum contribution</strong> of <strong>$10,453.20</strong> from <strong>employees</strong>, with <strong>employers matching</strong> this amount.</li>
            <li><strong>Medicare taxes</strong> have <strong>no wage base limit</strong>, meaning the <strong>1.45% Medicare tax</strong> (<strong>2.9% for self-employed</strong>) applies to <strong>all income</strong>, with an <strong>additional 0.9% Medicare surtax</strong> on <strong>earnings over $200,000</strong> (<strong>$250,000</strong> for <strong>married couples filing jointly</strong>).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Why Is This Important?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The <strong>cap limits</strong> how much <strong>high earners contribute</strong> to <strong>Social Security</strong>, leading to <strong>debates</strong> about <strong>fairness</strong> and <strong>system funding</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Proposals</strong> to <strong>raise</strong> or <strong>eliminate the cap</strong> aim to <strong>increase revenue</strong> for <strong>Social Security</strong>, potentially <strong>extending its solvency</strong>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="mt-4">Potential Impact of Raising the Wage Base to $1 Million</h3>
        <p>Raising the <strong>Social Security Wage Base</strong> to <strong>$1 million</strong> could generate approximately <strong>$13.38 billion</strong> in additional revenue annually. This change would enhance the <strong>solvency of the Social Security program</strong> and provide a more <strong>equitable distribution of payroll taxes</strong> among <strong>high earners</strong>. It is estimated that this change could extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund to approximately <strong>2075</strong>.</p>
