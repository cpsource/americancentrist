        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">A Centrist Form of Government</h1>
        <p class="lead">There are three primary forms of government currently shaping the United States. Understanding them is crucial for making informed political decisions.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>1. Plutocracy – Government by Billionaires</h2>
        <p>A plutocracy is a government controlled by a small group of ultra-wealthy individuals who dictate policies based on their financial interests. Today, this is represented by the <b>Republican Party/Trump</b>, with figures like <b>Elon Musk</b> playing a significant role.</p>
        <p>For example, Musk has proposed using taxpayer money to establish a Bitcoin reserve at the Federal Reserve—an idea that raises serious concerns about economic stability. Additionally, under Trump, the U.S. <b>GDP dropped from a positive 2.6% to a negative 2.5%</b>, a significant downturn in economic performance.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Corporatism – Government by and for Corporations</h2>
        <p>Corporatism prioritizes the interests of major corporations over the needs of everyday citizens. This is the model largely associated with the <b>Democratic Party</b>, including figures like <b>Biden and Clinton</b>.</p>
        <p>A major issue with corporatism is its neglect of the working class. Policies such as <b>free trade agreements</b> often result in jobs being outsourced to lower-cost regions, leaving American workers behind. The pursuit of maximum profit under unrestrained capitalism has led to deep economic disparities.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Working/Middle-Class Centrist – Government for the People</h2>
        <p>A truly <b>centrist government</b> would focus on the needs of the <b>working and middle classes</b>, ensuring fairness in taxation and economic opportunities. This ideology aligns with leaders like <b>Bernie Sanders and Chris Hedges</b>.</p>
        <p>For instance, closing the <b>'carried interest' tax loophole</b>, which primarily benefits the wealthy, could return <b>$1.3 billion per year</b> to middle-class families in the form of <b>direct financial relief, free childcare, or medical care</b>. The <b>American Centrist Party</b> aims to implement such policies to ensure economic balance.</p>
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>Recent events highlight the stark contrast between these three forms of governance.</p>
        <p><strong>Plutocracy</strong> often ends in revolution, as history has shown. Many MAGA supporters now express <b>voter remorse</b> as they begin to understand the economic consequences of past decisions.</p>
        <p>For example, after the last election, Google searches for <strong>'What is a tariff?'</strong> spiked, revealing a fundamental lack of economic understanding among voters. Meanwhile, <b>Tennessee is suffering the consequences</b> of misguided trade policies—Canada has boycotted all Tennessee exports, including bourbon. This results in a <b>$4 billion loss</b> in trade, dropping total exports from <b>$16 billion to $12 billion</b>, leading to massive job losses.</p>
        
        <p>Returning to a <b>Corporatist</b> model seems unlikely. The <b>Democrats have lost the trust of the working class</b>, with policies like NAFTA-II serving as a reminder of their failures.</p>
        
        <p>This leaves the need for a <b>Centrist alternative</b>—a government that <b>educates and supports</b> the working and middle class instead of prioritizing billionaires and corporations.</p>
