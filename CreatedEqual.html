        <h1>"All Men Are Created Equal"</h1>
        <p>The phrase <span class="highlight">"all men are created equal"</span> does not appear in the U.S. Constitution, but it is one of the most famous lines from the <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> (1776), written primarily by Thomas Jefferson.</p>
        
        <h2>Where Does This Phrase Come From?</h2>
        <p>The phrase appears in the <strong>preamble</strong> of the Declaration of Independence:</p>
        <blockquote>
            "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
        </blockquote>
        <p>This statement was a foundational principle for American independence, asserting that all people have <strong>natural rights</strong> that should not be denied.</p>
        
        <h2>Does the U.S. Constitution Say This?</h2>
        <p>While the U.S. Constitution (1787) does not use this phrase, it later incorporated legal protections for <strong>equality</strong> through amendments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The 14th Amendment (1868) – Equal Protection Clause:</strong> "No state shall... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." This ensured legal equality.</li>
            <li><strong>The 15th Amendment (1870):</strong> Prohibited denying voting rights based on "race, color, or previous condition of servitude."</li>
            <li><strong>The 19th Amendment (1920):</strong> Extended voting rights to women, further advancing legal equality.</li>
            <li><strong>The Civil Rights Act (1964):</strong> Reinforced legal equality and prohibited discrimination.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Key Differences Between the Declaration and the Constitution</h2>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Contains "All men are created equal"</td>
                <td>No direct mention of this phrase</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Focuses on <strong>natural rights</strong> and <strong>moral equality</strong></td>
                <td>Focuses on <strong>legal rights</strong> and <strong>governance</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Justified independence from Britain</td>
                <td>Provides the structure of government and laws</td>
            </tr>

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <p>The phrase <span class="highlight">"Created Equal"</span> means that all individuals in America are fundamentally equal. This includes the right to make personal choices, such as selecting your own doctor, practicing your religion freely, or expressing your beliefs without interference from others. The <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong> affirms these rights as unrestricted. However, it does not grant anyone the right to impose their beliefs or choices upon others. True equality means respecting the freedoms of all individuals, not using one’s own freedoms to limit or control others.</p>

        <p>This is an umbrella topic that folds in LGBTQI+, D.E.I., WOKE, and men's and woman's healthcare among others. For any given topic, just ask yourself how <span class="highlight">"Created Equal"</span> can be applied and you'll get your answer.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Although the phrase "all men are created equal" originates in the <strong>Declaration of Independence</strong>, its ideas were later incorporated into U.S. law through constitutional amendments. The <strong>14th Amendment</strong> and subsequent legislation ensured that the principle of equality became legally enforceable, shaping the modern concept of civil rights.</p>
