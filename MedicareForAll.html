        <h1 class="text-center mb-4">Medicare for All</h1>
        <p class="lead">Medicare, a successful program for seniors, should be expanded to cover all Americans. The U.S. is unique in not guaranteeing healthcare as a right, despite spending significantly more than other nations with worse outcomes.</p>
        <hr>

        <p>We are the richest country on earth while millions lack affordable care, leading to unnecessary deaths and financial hardship. Medicare for All will also cover dental, hearing, vision care, and nursing home care.</p>

        <p>A single-payer Medicare for All system would provide comprehensive, cost-effective coverage, eliminating complex private insurance and high drug costs. It would save billions in administrative costs and ensure everyone receives necessary care, ending the worry of medical bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>The current healthcare system is unsustainable, costing trillions and enriching insurance and drug companies. Medicare for All guarantees healthcare as a right, providing peace of mind during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

        <p>The U.S. currently spends nearly 18 percent of our GDP on health care – over $10,000 per person. If we continue without change, we will spend an estimated nearly $60 trillion over the next decade on health care. Meanwhile, drug companies and insurance companies make hundreds of billions of dollars in profits each year. That is unaffordable, unsustainable and unacceptable.</p>

        <p>Studies show that our federal government could save up to $500 billion per year on administrative costs by moving to Medicare for All.

        <p>After proposing Medicare for all Americans, I received this reply on a blog, and I would like to comment.</p>

                <p>@Sir, I've got news for you. If Americans supported universal healthcare, we would have had it decades ago. Medicare for all is a nonstarter. Why? Because Americans don't believe in paying taxes or supporting the undeserving poor. Bernie's wish list is popular with a specific small segment of the population, but it is nowhere near the numbers it would take to get elected president. Bernie supporters refuse to face reality when it comes to their guy, much like the trump MAGAs, come to think of it.</p>

                    <li>Americans do support universal healthcare. The reason we don’t have it today is that the healthcare industry has successfully lobbied against it.</li>
                    <li>As proposed here, universal healthcare would be entirely funded by a tax on the billionaire classes. No financial burden will be imposed on the working and middle classes. Therefore, the objection about paying for ‘the undeserving poor’ goes away.</li>
                    <li>The reasons you do want universal healthcare include: you’ll live longer if you have healthcare, you won’t go broke and tossed out on the street if you get sick, and you’ll live a more vital and healthy life.</li>
                    <li>Equating Bernie’s wish list with MAGA’s is irrelevant.</li>
